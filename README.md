ImGui-for-Blueprints
============

This is a fork of [UnrealImGui](https://github.com/segross/UnrealImGui) which is an Unreal Engine Plugin that integrates [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library. Additionally, this code contains a lot of improvements from [WiggleWizard's fork](https://github.com/WiggleWizard/UnrealImGui).
Dear ImGui is an immediate-mode graphical user interface library that is widely used in Engine/Game Development, due to its simplicity.

This fork is ment to **expose high-level ImGui functionality to Blueprint Visual Scripting**.

Right now, I use this repo for my personal Unreal Engine projects as a quick way of creating Debugers.
